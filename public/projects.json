    "description": "Webite is a food ordering app designed to bridge the gap between home cooks and friends. This project was deeply personal, as I am an passionate home cook who sells home-cooked meals to my friends due to the lack of food options at University. The app was developed to streamline order management and enhance the user experience, transcending the limitations of traditional communication and management methods used previously. \n\nPrior to developing Webite, I relied on Excel spreadsheets to keep track of orders and payments. This method, while somewhat effective, became increasingly annoying and troublesome as the volume of orders grew. Managing these spreadsheets was time-consuming and error-prone, leading to challenges in tracking payments accurately and efficiently.\n\nCommunication with friends was primarily conducted through WhatsApp. While this platform provided a basic means to notify and update menu information, it lacked organization and was not optimal for managing a growing customer base. The interface did not support the structured presentation of menu items, nor did it allow for easy modifications and updates in real-time. This often resulted in confusion and miscommunication.\n\nWebite revolutionizes this process by offering a centralized platform where I can manage menus, take orders, and process payments seamlessly. Its tailored interface is designed specifically for culinary commerce, enabling better organization, real-time updates, and a more engaging user experience compared to the ad-hoc systems previously used.\n\nThe introduction of Webite has significantly improved the operational efficiency and satisfaction of both the cook and the customers, proving to be a substantial upgrade over the combination of Excel and WhatsApp.",
