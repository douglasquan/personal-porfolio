        "text": "Webite is a food ordering app designed to bridge the gap between home cooks and friends. This project was deeply personal, as I am an passionate home cook who sells home-cooked meals to my friends due to the lack of food options at University. The app was developed to streamline order management and enhance the user experience, transcending the limitations of traditional communication and management methods used previously. \n\nPrior to developing Webite, I relied on Excel spreadsheets to keep track of orders and payments. This method, while somewhat effective, became increasingly annoying and troublesome as the volume of orders grew. Managing these spreadsheets was time-consuming and error-prone, leading to challenges in tracking payments accurately and efficiently.\n\nCommunication with friends was primarily conducted through WhatsApp. While this platform provided a basic means to notify and update menu information, it lacked organization and was not optimal for managing a growing customer base. The interface did not support the structured presentation of menu items, nor did it allow for easy modifications and updates in real-time. This often resulted in confusion and miscommunication.\n\nWebite revolutionizes this process by offering a centralized platform where I can manage menus, take orders, and process payments seamlessly. Its tailored interface is designed specifically for culinary commerce, enabling better organization, real-time updates, and a more engaging user experience compared to the ad-hoc systems previously used.\n\nThe introduction of Webite has significantly improved the operational efficiency and satisfaction of both the cook and the customers, proving to be a substantial upgrade over the combination of Excel and WhatsApp."

        "text": "The inspiration behind developing this scheduling app stemmed from the noticeable inefficiencies and limitations present in existing scheduling solutions. Many of these applications often require cumbersome steps to simply set up a meeting, lack intuitive interfaces, or do not offer flexible scheduling options that cater to the varying availability and preferences of all participants.\n\nMy scheduling app addresses these problems by:\n\n - Simplifying User Authentication: Users can create an account with just their email, making the entry barrier as low as possible.\n\n - Enhanced Flexibility in Scheduling: Unlike many other apps, this platform allows the host to propose multiple time slots and lets the invitees indicate their availability preferences as high, medium, or low. This feature ensures that the final meeting time accommodates the preferences of all participants as much as possible, significantly reducing scheduling conflicts.\n\n - Centralized and Intuitive Dashboard: All scheduled meetings are displayed on a calendar view, providing a holistic and easy-to-navigate overview. Users can manage, accept, and finalize invitations effortlessly from a single page.\n\n - Improved Communication: The ability to leave notes for each meeting invites—ranging from logistical details to personal messages—facilitates better communication and personalization.\n\nThese features collectively provide a more user-friendly, efficient, and flexible scheduling experience, addressing the shortcomings of existing tools and enhancing user satisfaction."

        "text": "The motivation for developing the Jyutping to Chinese character transliteration app stems from significant challenges within the Cantonese-speaking communities, particularly in handling linguistic data for NLP applications. These challenges include inconsistencies in Jyutping transcriptions, lack of standardization, and the presence of transcription errors from heritage speakers who are not fluent. Such issues have stymied the progress of various NLP projects, making the systematic generation of character transcriptions crucial.\n\nThis app addresses these problems by enhancing the consistency and reliability of Jyutping transcriptions. By improving how Jyutping is converted to Chinese characters, the app not only facilitates linguistic research and technological applications like speech-to-text and machine translation but also plays a vital role in preserving the Cantonese language and cultural heritage. This is particularly important as Cantonese holds the position of the second most spoken immigrant language in Toronto, enriching its cultural fabric. Through more accurate and efficient transliteration methods, this app aims to bridge communication gaps across generations and support the integration of heritage languages into modern tech platforms."

        "text": "The Transformer model was chosen over other architectures like RNNs or LSTMs for several reasons: \n\n -Attention Mechanism: Transformers utilize a self-attention mechanism which helps in capturing complex and non-linear relationships between Jyutping and Chinese characters, crucial for addressing the nuances of transliteration tasks.\n\n -Parallel Processing: Unlike RNNs that process data sequentially, Transformers handle multiple data points simultaneously, enhancing speed and efficiency, which is vital for processing large datasets.\n\n -Handling Long-Term Dependencies: RNNs often struggle with long-term dependencies due to vanishing gradients. Transformers overcome this limitation by using positional encodings and attention mechanisms, providing a more robust understanding of context.\n\n -Scalability: Transformers are more scalable to larger datasets, which is beneficial for training with extensive corpora needed for robust transliteration models."
